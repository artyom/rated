Command rated implements standalone rate-limiting service with http
interface.

Its http endpoint accepts requests with non-empty query string used as a key
to check against limited set of buckets to do token-based rate limiting.

It responds either with 204 is request should be allowed, or 429 if it
should be limited.

Note that because of limited amount of buckets in use collisions are
expected.
